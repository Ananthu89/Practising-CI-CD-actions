Scripts with Python

Note: A continuous integration (CI) action has been added successfully. To complete all the tests successfully we need to add two files ('requirments.txt' and 'test_example.py'). The latter needs to have an "assert" statement, and replacing that with a "return" command leads to failure. The 'requirments.txt' may not be as mandatory as the other one.
